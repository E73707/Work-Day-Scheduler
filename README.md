# Work-Day-Scheduler

This Weeks project involved building the javascript logic behind a work day schedule web page. The web page was designed to Accept user input into a textbox representing a specific time during the day, and saving the input to local storage so that the user has a saved schedule. Additionally the project, utilised dayJs to keep track of the current date aswell as the time in order to display whether or not the corresponding textboxes were either before, after or during the current time.
